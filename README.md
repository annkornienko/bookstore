### Bookstore App

This is a single-page application that allows users to manage a list of books. The main page displays a list of books with their names, prices, categories, and a delete button for each book. Users can add new books using the "Add Book" button and edit existing books by clicking on their names.

### Technologies Used

- React (with Hooks)
- Redux (with Redux Toolkit)
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Lazy Loading for improved performance
- Styling with CSS Modules

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm.
3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Bookstore app.

## Notes

The backend is simulated using an array to store the book list.
Redux with Redux Toolkit is used for state management and hooks are used for component-level state.
